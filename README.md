ex.1 
  Algorithmic problem, called it Parser.
  Used std::bitset in it mainly because it keeps readability on a high level.
  Keeping all these "protocols" as strings would\`ve taken much more memory.
  Could\`ve also for example read data to integers, and use binary operations,
  but that would be slow.
  
ex. 2
  Just a typical decToBin and binToDec converter.
  
ex.3
  OnBoardComputer program.
  Written with emphasis on project structure.
  Showed some object oriented programming techniques like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction.
  Alse used observer pattern (DataCollector and Loggers).
  Kinda proud of it. :)
